3	__label1__	3	N	Baby	B000I5UZ1Q	Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Starlight	doesn't swing very well.	I purchased this swing for my baby. She is 6 months now and has pretty much out grown it. It is very loud and doesn't swing very well. It is beautiful though. I love the colors and it has a lot of settings, but I don't think it was worth the money.
4	__label1__	4	N	Office Products	B003822IRA	Casio MS-80B Standard Function Desktop Calculator	Great computing!	I was looking for an inexpensive desk calcolatur and here it is. It works and does everything I need. Only issue is that it tilts slightly to one side so when I hit any keys it rocks a little bit. Not a big deal.
5	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B00PWSAXAM	Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System - No Sensitivity	Only use twice a week	I only use it twice a week and the results are great. I have used other teeth whitening solutions and most of them, for the same results I would have to use it at least three times a week. Will keep using this because of the potency of the solution and also the technique of the trays, it keeps everything in my teeth, in my mouth.

But this is a relatively unheard of brand, some even say a non existant company. Look at how amateur their labels and products are. You have to ask yourself if you would trust this kind of amateur stuff? No way! Don't waste your money.

13	__label1__	4	N	Kitchen	B00JEGSZCQ	Stainless Steel Tumbler with Straw- Hot and Cold Double Wall Drinking Mug- 16 oz.	Works great	I love this tumbler! Keeps drinks warm or cold for a good period of time, and its very sturdy. I get complements on how sleek it looks all the time, especially because it doesnt leave fingerprints. Highly recommend. Only suggestion when washing the lid, be sure to shake it and dry well to prevent dripping when the lid is on the tumbler.
14	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B000TD0PXU	Now Foods Mood Support With St Johns Wort Veg-capsules, 90-Count	Just OK	Only giving this 3 stars because it is so cheap. Has a very mild sedative effect, other than that it's pretty useless for stress/anxiety/panic attacks. Save your money ad get some ZenRx.

15	__label1__	4	N	Furniture	B0019QITHK	Boss Caressoft Medical Stool, black	Color Is Accurate	I bought 2 of these in brown for my island. The hydraulic mechanism looks as though it might fail with over use, but otherwise, I really like them. The color is accurate, as is the description. There is some padding, but not much. Definitely not a chair that you would lounge around in, but great for a bar/counter in the kitchen.

17	__label1__	4	Y	Camera	B00E56WY18	Falcon Zero F360 HD DVR Dual Dash Cam, Rear View Mirror, 1080p, 32GB SD Card (Black)	Good design, but a recommendation	Video quality if superb, fits just fine, looks like a real mirror (I believe they enhanced this), my only gripe is I wish they put the cameras not side by side, but one on one side, the other on the other side. I only say this because due to where the left camera is place, there is wasted recording room when you start to turn it towards the driver side. Otherwise very happy with this so far.
18	__label1__	4	N	Sports	B000HE8NK8	Barnett Diablo Slingshot	good enough	As sling shots go, this is good enough for my purposes. Though, I would have preferred for the handle to be slimmer for better grip.
19	__label1__	4	Y	Kitchen	B00FJKEGRY	Cuisavour's Deluxe Spiral Slicer with Japanese Stainless Steel Blades and 2 Premium Julienne Sizes	I just wish that there were guides and manuals for this	just to be fair, i really believe that this is a great slicer , and the idea was there, but unfortunately there are tricks when using this spiral slicer, i mean manual or something would have been helpful.<br /><br />I'm not saying something negative about this slicer because it does work, but however it did it took me almost a week in trying to learn how to use this slicer in cutting different kinds of vegetable.<br />the price i may say is fair, but i do wish that there were manuals in every box in showing us how to use this slicer properly.
